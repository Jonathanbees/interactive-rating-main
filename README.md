# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge developed by myself.


## Issues during the creation of this challenge
# Distribution of buttons
 - Create each button (the 5 circles of the rate) was so difficult especcially because i was changing sometimes the HTML elements, for example, at the beggining i create these with only div division, then, searching, i found that is easier to create input and label elements to just hide the input elements and work with the label elements, but at least i learn a little more about html forms :)
 - i didnÂ´t find the way to put the 5 circles and the button at the same time thinking about how can i do to validate that the input element needs to be selected before pressing the button to show the next section, i appreciate if anyone can advice me about it, this will help me a lot
# Javascript functionalities
- First of all, during the creation of the click function to change the color of the selected circle i was a little confused of how can i pick all of the 5 items without having a id or a class according to each of these (in the code i let some of my attempts to recreate that function seeing that all of that was true :3)
- then, i donÂ´t understand so much of how can i collect the information of the button (the number) that was pressed, after a few attemps, i found that the method: stringify() can help me with that and then, just transform my string into a char with just a chartAt method
- Finally, i understand that i can just add or remove classes (like the click function) to hide or show the part that is interesting to me, in this case, the thanks section once i press the submit button, i also learn a little of how to create HTML elements with javascript to push them in the section that i needed

## Learnings during the developing of this challenge

- I learn a lot more about some CSS elements, i hope that one day i will do it more mechanically :), itÂ´s obvious that i need to learn a lot more, and maybe in this challenge the code itÂ´s not the better optimized, but itÂ´s an attemp, i need to learn more about specially in the responsive design, because i donÂ´t understand a lot of how to do that, i will be very gratefull if someone can give me some advices according to this

- I learn a little more about javascript DOM manipulation, itÂ´s a long way to understand all the javascript that i want to learn, but one step a time, if you read this, if you can give me advices of my distribution of my javascript code to improve it, or explain me of how could i resolve the issues that i had, iÂ´ll be very grateful :3
